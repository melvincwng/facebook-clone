## Extras:
There are **4** animated background images available **(spring, summer, autumn, winter)**. One of them will be randomly chosen when you load the webpage. Which one will you get ðŸ˜‰?

Please also take note when visiting the website, Google Search Console may **mistakenly** flag a warning page on your screen due to it's high resemblance with the actual Facebook login page. 

To get to the actual website from the warning page, simply click **'Details'** > **'Visit this unsafe site'**.

Please be assured that this is a **safe** website - it's a pure frontend webpage that I've included as one of my portfolio projects. That's it - no server/database backend logic, entirely frontend code only ^^.
